# TiDB Cloud Quick Start

This Hands-on-Workshop was created for the 2022 HTAP Summit conference. The goal is to get people to create free TiDB Cloud accounts and use them. 

This material my be useful to others. If you have an OKR or MBO that requires you to give a presentation on a technical topic, feel free to use this material. You may want to change the slide template so that it doesn't say "HTAP Summit." If you do, it is best to use a dark background for the slides.

Pull the slides and replace my name with your name on the title slide. You may want to remove the first slide in the deck. I included slides like this so that people understand what I will cover in my conference presentations. This helps them decide if they want to attend or if their time is better spent in a different conference presentation. In short, the people who attend my conference presentations should want to be there.
